Notes
=====

Notes is a small notebook webapp written in AngularJs. There is no backand
(yet) so instead of saving objects they are dumped to 'console.log'.

This is basically my AngularJs playground to become fmiliar with the framework.


License
-------

Same as for the AngularJs version used in this project. Files in the
'bootstrap' folder have the same license as the upstream project
(<http://getbootstrap.com/>).
