Notes
=====

Notes is a small notebook webapp written in AngularJs. There is no remote
backand so objects are written to locale storage (html5 `localStorage`).

This demonstrates a way to deploy applications via html5 while maintaining the
data privacy of an offline app. Combined with a manifest and an 'check for
updates' button the user would also maintain how often the server sees the app
is being used.

It's really just a minimal proof of concept and my introduction to AngularJs,
I love it!
